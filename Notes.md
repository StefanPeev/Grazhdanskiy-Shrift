The reform of Peter I has begun the civilian alphabet in Russia (and then among all other peoples who use the Cyrillic alphabet), but careful consideration in the sources shows that the process does not follow the royal will unceasingly, but involves many abnormalities that require self-study and explanation. I do not have enough bibliography to try to study deviations, but clearly empirically some of them can be identified. The first significant distinction in the civilian font (noted by [Vladimir Yefimov](https://typejournal.ru/en/articles/Civil-Type)) is the difference between large-size glyphs and glyphs in the medium and small size. But **much more curious** are not the structural differences in the font size, but **the differences within each of the dimensions**. Here is one small example from a book published in **1708 year**.
